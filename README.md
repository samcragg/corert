[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/0vk7m4o4oxikdg72/branch/autocrat?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/samcragg/corert/branch/autocrat)

This is a fork of the CoreRT repository that removes the garbage collector from
the runtime and enables the compiler to be part of a smaller NuGet packages. It
is used as part of the Autocrat project.

The licence and code of conduct from the original project still apply.
